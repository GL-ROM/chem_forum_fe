## Description
My partner is an Organic Chemistry Doctorate student and they work for a summer program which preps incoming students for college classes. She currently teaches Chemistry in the program and finds that students tend to have a hard time grasping the concepts and math side of chemistry. 

So I decided to set out and create a space where chemistry can be discussed and helped by those who know along with the ability to take practice tests. I wanted to keep it simple and build using rails. I aimed to keep it very simple and straight forward.
